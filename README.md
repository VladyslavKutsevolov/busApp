* Ever sit on a bus on your commute to work and witness an accident on the bus due to the driver?
* Ever have a passenger abuse another passenger or the driver?
* Ever witness an accident from the bus? To the bus? To a nearby vehicle? Etc.

## This app is meant to cover some of these issues in a structured manner so the city you live in has a way to learn more about what's happening to the systems they are in charge of and the public can see transparent feedback
